# About Enigma I machine
The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early to mid-20th century to protect commercial, 
diplomatic, and military communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military. 
The Enigma machine was considered so secure that it was used to encipher the most top-secret messages.

There are many Enigma models, but this application simulates the Enigma I model. Initially, the machine was supplied with three coding wheels, that could be 
inserted in any of 6 possible orders (3 x 2 x 1). In December 1938, two additional wheels were supplied, bringing the total number of possible wheel orders 
to 60 (5 x 4 x 3), a 10-fold increase in cipher security![1]](#1)


The machine was used throughout WWII and is known under various names. It is officially known as Enigma I and by its factory designator: Ch.11a.
